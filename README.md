# Final project API's and MongoDB

As it was my final project at Technigo, I decided to wrap up everything I have learnt during the program and build one bigger application. 
General idea of the project: a platform for buying, adopting and selling pets. You can categorise pets to find the perfect pet. For example to search for 'small dogs under 2 years old'. 
Since it's just a demo, I made a dummy-data for dogs and dog breeds, so I could make my collections based on the data. 
I've made three collections for dogs, dog breeds and users who should be authorized first in order to publish an ad.

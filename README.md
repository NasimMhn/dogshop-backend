## Final Project backend

As it was my final project at Technigo, I decided to wrap up everything I have learnt during the program and build one larger application. General idea of the project: Platform for buying, adopting and selling pets. You can search by category to find the perfect dog for you. For example youc an search for 'small' dog of the type 'toy' in a certain price range. Since this is just a demo, I'm  using dummy-data for the dogs. 
You have to be authorized before posting a dog - meaning you must create an account and login first. Frontend repo: https://github.com/Nasimmhn/dogshop-frontend
